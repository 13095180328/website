## Origin of Iron Fish

Iron Fish (previously known as Beanstalk) was founded in 2018 by Elena Nadolinski. The idea came after seeing how payments accelerated their progression to being digital-only. Bitcoin was initially created with the goal of digital cash, but the initial promise has never been fulfilled. Transactions are slow, expensive, and fully public. Elena wanted to offer a new cryptocurrency that is fast, fully private, and anonymous.

## Why the name Iron Fish?

During World War 2, the US recruited Native Americans to use their tribal
languages to send secret communications to and from the battlefield
– a system that was unbroken until it was declassified in the late
60s.

One of their code systems contained words that were directly
translated from English to Navajo for common military words. Certain
modern military words didn’t have a direct translation to Navajo,
and so they had to improvise. The term for ‘submarine’ therefore
became what directly translates to as ‘iron fish’.

We chose this as our name because it shows the power of
cryptography, how a complex modern concept can be described using
relatively simple words, and it even has two tradable commodities
(iron and fish) right in its name.
