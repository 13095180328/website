# FAQ
## What are we building?

A cryptocurrency that does not compromise on privacy.

## How is this different than other cryptocurrencies?

Many popular cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others) offer the least private way of transacting. They are a permanent ledger that publicly broadcasts all the details of a transaction – analogous to tweeting out your bank statement. We believe privacy is a requirement for a true global currency. We also believe cryptocurrencies should be easy to use – both to the end consumer, and to the miner. We developed a fast syncing technique that lets miners download significantly less data and onboard faster than existing cryptocurrency systems.

## How are we achieving privacy?

We are working with cutting edge cryptography using zero-knowledge. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a breakthrough tool in cryptography that prove honest computation. By using ZKPs we can build private transactions that fully hide the sender, the recipient and the amount, while providing a proof that the transaction is valid. Every transaction on Iron Fish is private such that no one sees the details of an account unless the owner grants read-only permissions via view keys. This level of privacy is unprecedented when compared to other cryptocurrencies or traditional banking plans.

## Why use Proof-of-Work (PoW)?

Proof-of-Work (PoW) was pioneered by Bitcoin to create a consensus mechanism between decentralized and trust-less parties. While we don’t like the environmental aspects of PoW, current alternatives, like PoS, haven’t caught up.

## Why build a new privacy coin?

While there are other privacy coin projects such as Monero, Zcash, and Grin, they all have drawbacks on either privacy, usability, or both. We’re building a cryptocurrency that takes no compromise on privacy with a strong focus on usability.
